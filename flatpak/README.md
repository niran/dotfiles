`save_installed_packages.sh` collects the flatpak bundles that have been installed and generates a script called `flatpak_batch_install.sh` to reinstall them on another machine. The motivating use case was to ensure that Linux GUI utility apps that are useful on a Chromebook can easily be installed in a Crostini container on another Chromebook as long as flatpak is installed and a repository is configured.
